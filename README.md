## My process

First I analysed the challenge picture and broke it down into boxes. I then wrote the HTML to match my breakdown and build up the styling bit by bit.

### Built with

- Vanilla HTML and CSS

### What I learned

I already knew all of the CSS properties I used but did not have much practice with flexbox. It was great to dive into how i can replicate a design by using is as the main layout tool.
